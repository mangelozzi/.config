" In Linux there are multiple clipboard like buffers called selections:
"   The PRIMARY (*) selection is updated every time you select text. To paste from it (in graphical programs), middle-click or use ShiftInsert. In Vim, it is accessible through the "* register.
"   The CLIPBOARD (+) selection is updated when you explicitly cut or copy anything (text or other data). In other words, it is used just like the Windows or Mac OS clipboards. To paste from it, the usual shortcut is CtrlV in grapical programs. In Vim, it is accessible through the "+ register. In Windows:
"   * is the system clipboard
"   + is NOT the system clipboard
