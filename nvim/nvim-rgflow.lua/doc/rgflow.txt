This plugin is made for Neovim (not VIM compatible).

INTRODUCTION                                    *rgflow*

Allows one to flow with ripgrep from within Neovim. It is not simply a wrapper
which could be replaced by a few lines of config. It provdes the following functions:

By default will turn off relative number etc, can disable qf settings from applying 
by making a ftplugin/qf.vim file and putting this inside it:
	let b:did_ftplugin = 1


Highlight matches even if you use regex

Always add these flags:
local rg_args = {"--vimgrep", "--no-messages", "--replace",  "\30$0\30"}

Disables <C-^> and <C-S-^> and <C-6> when in the quickfix window.

COMMANDS                                        *rgflow-commands*

                                                *eunuch-:Cfind*
                                                *eunuch-:Find*
:Cfind[!] {args}        Run `find` and load the results into the quickfix
                        list.  Jump to the first result unless ! is given.

                                                *eunuch-:Lfind*
:Lfind[!] {args}        Run `find` and load the results into the location
                        list.  Jump to the first result unless ! is given.


                                                *eunuch-:Wall* *eunuch-:W*
:Wall                   Like |:wall|, but for windows rather than buffers.
:W                      It also writes files that haven't changed, which is
                        useful for kicking off build and test suites (such as
                        with watchr or guard).  Furthermore, it handily
                        doubles as a safe fallback for people who, like me,
                        accidentally type :W instead of :w a lot.
